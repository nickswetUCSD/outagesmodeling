## REINTRODUCTION

Nobody likes a blackout. They seem to always crop up when it's least convenient, leaving cities high and dry with malfunctioning traffic lights and citizens floundering with a lack of resources for poor laptop battery life.

Last time, we investigated the ins and outs of over **1500 rows** of U.S. power outage data¹ , courtesy of **Purdue University’s LASCI (Laboratory For Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure)**. We found some interesting conclusions:



- Outage data has many factors and causes🌪️ that make it complex to predict, and investigating that data as individual points or as aggregates can reveal contrasting trends.

-  Four states deviate from what is expected of the distribution of the greater United States in terms of OUTAGE.DURATION⏱.

- There is some overlap in the states that more commonly have longer power outages and the states who have a high number of mean CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED🚶 per outage.



**But can we take these conclusions and turn them into something actionable? Perhaps we can!**




### POSING A PREDICTION PROBLEM:
> ## Can we reasonably predict the magnitude of a blackout from other blackout features?
